# carrots

This is a python package: Carrots, has a class called Cat. It's designed for my 8 year daughter to use with the raspberry pi and a [Pimoroni Unicorn HAT HD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3580). 

The idea is to level up from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23857310/) to REAL programming, as my daughter would say. 

Instantiate as many Cats as you like, then give instructions to animate the Cat (which a dot that will move around on the Unicorn hat.
